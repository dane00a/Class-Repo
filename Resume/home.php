        <h3>A Brief History</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a backend programmer, proficient (enough) in PHP and SQL. <br>
          I'm usually partnered with a guy named Dimitri for frontend design, since he's the superior artistic talent, <br>
          But alas, College called... <br>
          I need to learn JS and Jquery, among other things.

        <h3>Where am I now?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm currently taking classes at <abbr title="Illinois Institute of Technology">IIT</abbr> to learn Javascript and associated libraries, such as JQuery.<br>
          Soon, I'll have the necessary skills to become a good frontend developer, and be able to design as well as navigate the backend of databases.

        <h3>What Will I Do In The Future?</h3>
        <p>
          I'm going to pursue one of the more abstract and difficult languages of web development: <abbr title="Asynchronous Javascript and XML">AJAX</abbr>.<br>
          This language is one of the most powerful when linked with a proficient web developer, especially when doing things such as GET and POST without PHP, <br>
          Retrieving and updating a page with information from a database without a refresh, and other little bits of powerful tools and uses.
